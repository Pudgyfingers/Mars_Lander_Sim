# Mars_Lander_simulation
This program simulates a 2D decent of a mars probe from 20,000 meters assuming thrust vector = drag vector and aiming for a final velocity of 2 m/s.

Inputs: burn altitude, fuel mass.

Outputs: 6 graphs (Trajectory, Speed, Mass flow, Altitude vs time, Speed vs time, Gamma (angle measured from x to y axis) vs time
